The bbPress Spam Cleaner helps clean up spam from existing forum posts.

== Description ==

I developed this plugin to help clean out existing bbPress forums that have been spammed. One of the issues I encountered when
performing a similar task was the lack of such a feature in existing plugins. Most seemed to catch new spam, but there was
no clear means to scan the existing forums.

bbPress Spam Cleaner simply scans existing posts and marks them as spam using Akismet.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `bbpress-spam-plugin` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Look for 'bbPress Spam Cleaner' under the 'Tools' menu in the admin area


== Changelog ==

= 0.1.1 =
This is the intial version
